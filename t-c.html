You also shall not use the Service in violation of any applicable laws or agreements that you have with any third parties. All express or implied rights to the Service not specifically granted herein are expressly reserved to GovTech.</p>

<p>3.3.  GovTech reserves the right to:</p>

<p>3.3.1.  Update or modify this Service from time to time;</p>

<p>3.3.2.  Deny or restrict access to or use of the Service by any particular person without ascribing any reasons whatsoever; and</p>

<p>3.3.3.  Discontinue or terminate this Service at any time without notice or liability to you whatsoever, whereupon all rights granted to you hereunder shall also terminate forthwith. You shall further upon notice from GovTech return or destroy all copies of the Service or materials therein that you may have downloaded.</p>

<p>3.4.  You will not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or otherwise do anything that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on GovTech’s servers.</p>

<p>3A. Account Access and Security</p>

<p>3A.1 You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any authentication credentials associated with your use of the Service, including the security of any of your devices which store the authentication credentials.</p>

<p>3A.2 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to verify the identity of the person using the Service. Without prejudice to the foregoing, GovTech is not under any duty to verify that any biometric identifier used with the Service, or on your device, belongs to you.</p>

<p>3A.3 GovTech shall have the sole and absolute discretion to invalidate any authentication credentials at any time, or require you to have to re-authenticate or refresh your authentication credentials at any time, without having to give any reason for the same.</p>

<p>3A.4 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to act upon or rely on any instructions, information, transmissions of data, or communications received from the account or use of the Service in relation to your authentication credentials, as if such instructions, information, data or communications were issued by you, whether or not the same was authorized by you.</p>

<p>3A.5 For the avoidance of doubt, you are solely responsible for any loss of whatever nature arising from unauthorized or unofficial modifications made to your device which permit or escalate privileged access, or remove restrictions to such access, which are not intended by the manufacturer or provider of your device or operating system of your device (e.g., “rooting” or “jailbreaking” your mobile phone).</p>

<h3 id="4--third-party-materials">4.  Third Party Materials</h3>

<p>4.1.  The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third party (“Third Party”). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the “Third Party Terms”). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution platform (the “Distribution Terms”). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.</p>

<p>4.2.  It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of the same. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user. For the avoidance of doubt, where Third Party Terms are listed, such Third Party Terms shall be deemed to include any privacy policies and acceptable use policies as are applicable to you.</p>

<p>4.3.  If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party Terms. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>

<p>4.3.1.  some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the Third Party to you; and</p>

<p>4.3.2.  the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your use of the relevant third party software or service, and not these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>4.4.  If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause 4.5  below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the “Incorporated Terms”). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are complied with, the parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance.</p>

<p>4.5.  Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.</p>

<p>4.6.  For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6.</p>

<h3 id="5--your-consent-to-access-functions-of-your-device">5.  Your Consent to Access Functions of Your Device</h3>

<p>Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to certain functions of your device, such as push notifications, the obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data from you in connection with the Service. Please also see privacy policy. Your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to the access by the Service of such functions of your device as may be reasonably required by the Service.</p>

<p>5A. Ownership of Feedback/Requests/Suggestions</p>

<p>You agree that all title and interest in any feedback, requests or suggestions from you concerning the Services shall be owned by GovTech.</p>

<p>5B. Confidentiality</p>

<p>5B.1 If you receive information or data (in whatever form) from GovTech or a Third Party which is designated confidential or proprietary or is otherwise reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary (collectively, “Confidential Information”), you shall not use, disclose or reproduce the Confidential Information except for the purpose for which it was provided to you. If consent to disclose the Confidential Information to a third party is given by GovTech or the Third Party to you, any act or omission in respect of the Confidential Information by that person shall be deemed to be your act or omission and you agree to be fully liable for the same. In all cases, you shall protect the Confidential Information to the same extent you protect your own confidential information but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. You shall ensure that any recipients are bound by confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as this Clause.</p>

<p>5B.2 You shall destroy any Confidential Information immediately upon request by GovTech or the Third Party.</p>

<p>5B.3 In the event:</p>

<p>5B.3.1 you are, or likely to be, required by an order of court to disclose Confidential Information; or</p>

<p>5B.3.2 you have reasonable grounds to suspect the unauthorised use or disclosure or reproduction of Confidential Information;</p>

<p>you shall immediately notify GovTech or the Third Party of the same and cooperate with GovTech or the Third Party to prevent or limit such disclosure.</p>

<p>5B.4 Nothing in this Clause 5B shall prejudice GovTech’s or the Third Party’s other rights at law.</p>

<h3 id="6--disclaimers-and-indemnity">6.  Disclaimers and Indemnity</h3>

<p>regardless of whether GovTech has been advised of the possibility of such damage or loss.</p>

<p>6.3.  Without prejudice and in addition to the foregoing, insofar as the Service facilitates or requires the provision, use or functioning of, or is provided in conjunction with, other products, software, materials and/or services not provided by GovTech, GovTech makes no representation or warranty in relation to such products, software, materials and/or services (including without limitation any representation or warranties as to timeliness, reliability, availability, interoperability, quality, fitness for purpose, non-infringement, suitability or accuracy).</p>

<p>6.4.  You shall not rely on any part of the Service to claim or assert any form of legitimate expectation against GovTech, whether or not arising out of or in connection with GovTech’s roles and functions as a public authority.</p>

<p>6.5.  You agree to defend and indemnify and keep GovTech and its officers, employees, agents and contractors harmless against all liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs on an indemnity basis) howsoever arising out of or in connection with your access or use of the Service (including third party software or services) or your non-compliance with the Terms of Use, Third Party Terms or Incorporated Terms, whether or not you had been advised or informed of the nature or extent of such liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses. You warrant and represent that your access or use of the Service does not and will not breach or violate any laws, regulations, trade, economic and/or export sanctions (wherever in the world) applicable to you, and that you shall not transmit any malicious code, illegal, infringing or undesirable content or materials to GovTech or its agents or any Third Party.</p>

<h3 id="7--hyperlinks">7.  Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>7.1.  Insofar as the Service provides a hyperlink to material not maintained or controlled by GovTech, GovTech shall not be responsible for the content of the hyperlinked material and shall not be liable for any damages or loss arising from access to the hyperlinked material. Use of the hyperlinks and access to such hyperlinked materials are entirely at your own risk. The hyperlinks are provided merely as a convenience to you and do not imply endorsement by, association or affiliation with GovTech of the contents of or provider of the hyperlinked materials.</p>

<p>7.2.  Caching and hyperlinking to, and the framing of, any part of the Service is prohibited save where you have obtained GovTech’s prior written consent. Such consent may be subject to any conditions as may be determined by GovTech in its sole discretion. If you hyperlink to or frame any part of the Service, that shall constitute your acceptance of these Terms of Use and all amendments thereto. If you do not accept these Terms of Use as may be amended from time to time, you must immediately discontinue linking to or framing of any part of the Service.</p>

<p>7.3.  GovTech reserves all rights:</p>

<p>7.3.1.  to disable any links to, or frames of, any materials which are unauthorised (including without limitation materials which imply endorsement by or association or affiliation with GovTech, materials containing inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful topics, names, or information that violates any written law, any applicable intellectual property, proprietary, privacy or publicity rights); and</p>

<p>7.3.2.  to disclaim responsibility and/or liability for materials that link to or frame any part of the Service.</p>

<p>10A. Severability</p>

<p>If any term of these Terms of Use is held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then these Terms of Use, including all of the remaining terms, will remain in full force and effect as if such invalid or unenforceable term had never been included but, to the extent permissible, such invalid or unenforceable terms shall be deemed to have been replaced by terms that are (a) valid and enforceable and (b) express the intention or produce the result closest to the original intention of the invalid or unenforceable terms.</p>
