## No set up is required
Unlike SMS and WhatsApp, Postman will handle the email sending for you. You do not need to do anything. Simply log in and start using Postman. 

## What email address will be in the from field if I were to send my messages out via Postman?
The from field will be [noreply@postman.gov.sg](mailto: noreply@postman.gov.sg "noreply@postman.gov.sg").
