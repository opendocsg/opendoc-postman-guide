The primary advantage of such set-up is that the past campaigns can be seen under one account for audit purpose."

Depending on your usage, Twilio has a few different plans. If you do pay-as-you-go, you only need a corporate credit card on file. It works like prepaid mobile plan. You top-up certain amounts of money every month and deplete the account as you send SMS. Post-paid mobile plans requires you to contact Twilio’s rep and initiate a procurement process that adheres to IM8 guidelines. Contact WhatsApp Business sales representatives to find out more about their business plans. Go to Before You Start - Twilio &amp; SMS for more info. Is there a bulk tender for Twilio?

In this Privacy Policy, “Public Sector Entities” means the Government (including its ministries, departments and organs of state) and public authorities (such as statutory boards). Insofar as the Service consists of or is provided to you through a website, please note that: 1.1. We may use “cookies”, where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track information about you when you enter our websites.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website. We may request certain types of data from you in connection with your access or use of the Service. The data that may be requested include those identified in the Annex herein. Your data may be stored in our servers, systems or devices, in the servers, systems or devices of our third party service providers or collaborators, or on your device, and may be used by us or our third party service providers or collaborators to facilitate your access or use of the Service. If you provide us with personally identifiable data: 3.1.

We may share necessary data with other Public Sector Entities, and third party service providers in connection with the Service, so as to provide the Service to you in the most efficient and effective way unless such sharing is prohibited by law. 3.3. We will NOT share your personal data with entities which are not Public Sector Entities, except where such sharing is necessary for such entities to assist us in providing the Service to you or for fulfilling any of the purposes in this Clause 3. 3.4. For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously supplied us or other Public Sector Entities.

These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of our services, including the application (whether as software or as a website or otherwise), its contents, push notifications and all other accompanying materials as identified in the Schedule below (collectively, the “Service”). 1.2. This Service is provided to you by the Government Technology Agency (“GovTech”). GovTech’s office is located at 10 Pasir Panjang Road, #10-01, Mapletree Business City, Singapore 117438. 1.3. By accessing or using any part of this Service, you unconditionally agree and accept to be legally bound by these Terms of Use and any amendments thereto from time to time. GovTech reserves the right to change these Terms of Use at its sole discretion and at any time. You should read the Terms of Use carefully each time you access or use any part of this Service as such access or use will constitute your agreement to the Terms of Use and any amendments to it. 1.4. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, please do not use this Service or any part of this Service. 1.5. If you are accessing or using the Service for and on behalf of another entity (such as your employer), you warrant and represent that you have the necessary authority to bind such entity to these Terms of Use. 2. Nature of this Service Please see the Schedule for more information and terms concerning this Service. 3. Licence Terms and Restrictions 3.1. The Service, including the materials made available on or through the Service, is owned by, licensed to, managed or controlled by GovTech. Please see clause 4 (Third Party Materials) for more information. 3.2. Subject to these Terms of Use, GovTech grants to you a non-exclusive, revocable, and non-transferable right to access and use the Service for personal or internal purposes only, and only for such use permitted by the functions of the Service and intended by GovTech. You shall not, amongst other things, benchmark, reproduce, modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, adapt, publish, redistribute or sublicense the Service or any part of the Service without the prior written consent of GovTech or the respective third party owners. You also shall not use the Service in violation of any applicable laws or agreements that you have with any third parties. All express or implied rights to the Service not specifically granted herein are expressly reserved to GovTech. 3.3. GovTech reserves the right to: 3.3.1. Update or modify this Service from time to time; 3.3.2. Deny or restrict access to or use of the Service by any particular person without ascribing any reasons whatsoever; and 3.3.3. Discontinue or terminate this Service at any time without notice or liability to you whatsoever, whereupon all rights granted to you hereunder shall also terminate forthwith. You shall further upon notice from GovTech return or destroy all copies of the Service or materials therein that you may have downloaded. 3.4. You will not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or otherwise do anything that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on GovTech’s servers. 3A. Account Access and Security 3A.1 You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any authentication credentials associated with your use of the Service, including the security of any of your devices which store the authentication credentials. 3A.2 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to verify the identity of the person using the Service. Without prejudice to the foregoing, GovTech is not under any duty to verify that any biometric identifier used with the Service, or on your device, belongs to you. 3A.3 GovTech shall have the sole and absolute discretion to invalidate any authentication credentials at any time, or require you to have to re-authenticate or refresh your authentication credentials at any time, without having to give any reason for the same. 3A.4 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to act upon or rely on any instructions, information, transmissions of data, or communications received from the account or use of the Service in relation to your authentication credentials, as if such instructions, information, data or communications were issued by you, whether or not the same was authorized by you. 3A.5 For the avoidance of doubt, you are solely responsible for any loss of whatever nature arising from unauthorized or unofficial modifications made to your device which permit or escalate privileged access, or remove restrictions to such access, which are not intended by the manufacturer or provider of your device or operating system of your device (e.g., “rooting” or “jailbreaking” your mobile phone). 4. Third Party Materials 4.1. The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third party (“Third Party”). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the “Third Party Terms”). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution platform (the “Distribution Terms”). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms. 4.2. It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of the same. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user. For the avoidance of doubt, where Third Party Terms are listed, such Third Party Terms shall be deemed to include any privacy policies and acceptable use policies as are applicable to you. 4.3. If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party Terms. For the avoidance of doubt: 4.3.1. some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the Third Party to you; and 4.3.2. the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your use of the relevant third party software or service, and not these Terms of Use. 4.4. If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the “Incorporated Terms”). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are complied with, the parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance. 4.5. Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you. 4.6. For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6. 5. Your Consent to Access Functions of Your Device Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to certain functions of your device, such as push notifications, the obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data from you in connection with the Service. Please also see privacy policy. Your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to the access by the Service of such functions of your device as may be reasonably required by the Service. 5A. Ownership of Feedback/Requests/Suggestions You agree that all title and interest in any feedback, requests or suggestions from you concerning the Services shall be owned by GovTech. 5B. Confidentiality 5B.1 If you receive information or data (in whatever form) from GovTech or a Third Party which is designated confidential or proprietary or is otherwise reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary (collectively, “Confidential Information”), you shall not use, disclose or reproduce the Confidential Information except for the purpose for which it was provided to you. If consent to disclose the Confidential Information to a third party is given by GovTech or the Third Party to you, any act or omission in respect of the Confidential Information by that person shall be deemed to be your act or omission and you agree to be fully liable for the same. In all cases, you shall protect the Confidential Information to the same extent you protect your own confidential information but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. You shall ensure that any recipients are bound by confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as this Clause. 5B.2 You shall destroy any Confidential Information immediately upon request by GovTech or the Third Party. 5B.3 In the event: 5B.3.1 you are, or likely to be, required by an order of court to disclose Confidential Information; or 5B.3.2 you have reasonable grounds to suspect the unauthorised use or disclosure or reproduction of Confidential Information; you shall immediately notify GovTech or the Third Party of the same and cooperate with GovTech or the Third Party to prevent or limit such disclosure. 5B.4 Nothing in this Clause 5B shall prejudice GovTech’s or the Third Party’s other rights at law. 6. Disclaimers and Indemnity 6.1. The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind.

We have used Twilio for SMS sending service for NDP ticketing, Digital MC, SGH’s elective surgery appointment receipt and reminder, MOH’s quarantine notice, and ICA’s location checking for those who are on quarantine notice. Easy to setup &amp; well documented API Twilio, Nextmo and AWS SNS are all cloud base SMS solutions. Twilio’s primary benefit is that there is a simple user interface with an interactive debugger. Our developers have experiences integrating with Twilio. Twilio is known for its simple, and well documented API. Given that it is easy for us to integrate with Twilio and save significant manpower hours on setting up our own SMS gateway, Twilio was chosen as the service provider. Reliability &amp; availability Twilio API success rate is 99.999% &amp; uptime is ~ 99.95% (per month). Nexmo does not publicly declare its API success rate and uptime. AWS does not publicly declare its API success rate but uptime is ~99.90% (per month)."

An example would be MOE at the project level and Course: ecology 101 at the subproject level for ecology 101’s teacher to send SMS to parents. If you fall under a subproject, you need to navigate to Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Subproject &gt; “Subproject name like Course: ecology 101” &gt; Settings &gt; General to obtain your subproject SID.

If you wish to purchase a Singapore phone number that starts with +65, you need to complete a regulatory bundle. It will ask for an ID and business details for verification. Once your application for regulatory bundle has been approved then you can search for a phone number that starts with +65. Singapore phone number is $75 per month. We recommend that you buy a US phone number which is $1 per month if you are not doing 2-way messaging. SMS cost depends on the country code of the phone number. Please take note that a US phone number might cost more to send SMS. Once you have bought a number, you can go back to Messaging Service to complete the set up by linking a phone number to your messaging service."
