## Telegram Bot 
Telegram bot can broadcast message to recipients who are subscribed to the bot. Postman will be supporting agencies to deploy their Telegram bots.

**Recipient's experience**: Recipients will be asked by the agency to subscribe to the agency's Telegram bot to receive relevant information/broadcast messages from the Telegram bot. 

If you are interested in working with OGP on the Telegram bot pilot, please send us an email at postman@open.gov.sg

## 1. Set up a bot
Use a dedicated phone card to create an official telegram account. 

## 2. Message BotFather on Telegram to set up a bot
1. Start messaging BotFather (telegram.me/BotFather) on telegram and then type  /start.
2. You’ll see a list of commands that help you create, edit, and manage your bots. Since it’s your first time, type /newbot.
3. After giving the /newbot command, you get to pick a name and username for your bot. The name is what your users will see the bot as in their contact list and the username is how they’ll find it. 
4. With that done, you’ll be given your bot’s API token. The API token is how Telegram knows the message you send through Postman is associated with this particular bot. Every bot has its own API token, and you shouldn’t share it with anyone or they could hijack your bot.

## 3. Send us your Telegram bot token
We are currently doing manual onboarding at the moment. Copy the bot token into a .txt file and use [Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/ "Firefox Send") to send us the API token. 

You should email us with the following 

**Subject**: [Agency Name] Interest in Telegram Bot Pilot

**Content**: The link to the Firefox Send file. 

Firefox send lets you share files with end-to-end encryption and a link that automatically expires. Please set the download to 1 time only. This means that the Postman team would be the only people that can download the file. If you want to be extra safe then send us the link in one email and send us the password in a separate email. You can set a password lock for the link.
