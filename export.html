<h2 id="create-a-common-email">Create a common email</h2>
<p>Your login will be the primary email address that we will use to send your emails out to the recipients. Postman does not manage users for an agency. Twilio credentials will be tied to an agency email account. You might have to contact your IT administrator to create a common email account that allows multiple subscribers. The primary advantage of such set-up is that the past campaigns can be seen under one account for audit purpose.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-have-multiple-users-from-the-same-agency-sharing-the-same-account">Can I have multiple users from the same agency sharing the same account?</h2>
<p>Sharing is caring! All users from the same agency should share one account. The rationale behind our set-up is that communications out to the public should be vetted before you press send. Each agency has its own communication guidelines &amp; policy.</p>

<p>We leave it up to the communication team to govern the usage of Postman. If you are sending a message broadcast to the entire country, please make sure you get your use case vetted by the <a href="https://www.mci.gov.sg/" title="Ministry of Communications and Information">Ministry of Communications and Information</a>.</p>

<h2 id="save-your-credentials">Save your credentials</h2>

<p>Think of credentials as a passcode that you need to enter into a keypad in order to get into a door. We need your credentials to contact Twilio’s API. Different services would have different credential set-up. This guide will teach you how to get them and where to save them (see below).</p>

<h3 id="step-1-go-to-account">Step 1: Go to account</h3>
<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/accounts-landing.jpg" alt="accounts landing page" /></p>

<h3 id="step-2-add-in-your-twilio-credentials">Step 2: Add in your Twilio credentials</h3>
<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/accounts-enter-cred.jpg" alt="add credential" /></p>

<h3 id="step-3-put-in-your-mobile-number-to-validate-your-credential">Step 3: Put in your mobile number to validate your credential</h3>
<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/accounts-test-cred.jpg" alt="test credential" /></p>

<p>Receive a succes message once your credential has been validated.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/accounts-cred-valid.jpg" alt="credential valid" /></p>

<p>An SMS will also be sent to your mobile number.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/phone-cred-valid.jpg" alt="phone credential valid" /></p>

<p>You can go back to <strong>campaigns</strong> to start sending your SMS. The testing message page will have a dropwdown menu for you to select the credentials that you have saved in account. You can also choose to enter in a new set of credentials under campaign. The credentials entered for the campaign is only specific to that particular campaign. It <strong>will not be saved</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="remove-your-credentials">Remove your credentials</h2>

<p>There is no preview for the credentials saved yet (work in progress). Remove your credential by clicking on the trash icon.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/accounts-cred-added.jpg" alt="credential added" /></p>

<p>We will prompt you to make sure that it is the credential that you want to delete. Deletion is not reversible.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/accounts-delete-cred.jpg" alt="delete credential" /></p>

<h2 id="request-a-set-of-trial-credentials-for-sms-sending">Request a set of trial credentials for SMS sending.</h2>

<p>Please fill out the following <a href="https://form.gov.sg/5ebcd3b652407a00116942ec" title="FormSG form">form</a> and we will reach out to you.</p>

<h2 id="generate-an-api-key">Generate an API key</h2>

<p>If you would like to use Postman API to send SMS or email, you need to first enter in your credentials under <a href="./before-you-start.html#save-your-credentials" title="credentials">accounts</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/accounts-api-gen-1.jpg" alt="api gen 1" /></p>

<p>Copy the API key and you can start using Postman’s API to send SMS or email.

<p>Yes, please fill out the following <a href="https://go.gov.sg/postman-non-gov-sg-application" title="Form for non gov sg user">form</a> and we will get back to you.</p>

<h2 id="browser-compatibility">Browser Compatibility</h2>

<p>We only support Chrome, Firefox, and Samsung Internet at the moment. We have had issues with Postman on Internet Explorer 11 and we are actively fixing this issue.</p>

<h2 id="credentials">Credentials</h2>
<h3 id="can-i-see-what-postman-has-before-entering-a-credential">Can I see what Postman has before entering a credential?</h3>

<p>Yes, please go to <a href="/step-by-step-guide/" title="Section 2: Step by step">section 2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-would-i-know-that-my-credentials-are-working">How would I know that my credentials are working?</h3>

<p>Before you send an SMS or WhatsApp message to the citizens, we will ask you to put in your credentials and send a message to yourself to test the credentials. We recommend that you log onto Twilio so that you can copy and paste in the credentials when prompted.</p>

<h3 id="i-dont-know-how-to-find-my-twilio-credentials">I don’t know how to find my Twilio credentials!</h3>

<p>Go to <a href="/before-you-start/#setting-up-your-twilio-account/" title="Section 1: Before You Start">Before You Start</a> for more info.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="we-want-to-manage-subscription-like-mci-is-postman-going-to-support-this">We want to manage subscription like MCI. Is Postman going to support this?</h3>

<p>Subscription is currently not in the scope of Postman. It will likely be part of other productivity products under OGP.</p>

<h3 id="we-want-an-audit-function-so-we-can-check-the-sms-sent-timestamp">We want an audit function so we can check the SMS sent timestamp.</h3>

<p>We are not going to cover this feature in the first iteration of Postman. You can check when a SMS is sent by logging into your Twilio console and searching for the phone number. Your agency is the only one that can check through your Twilio account. We will not be able to access it.</p>

<h2 id="billing">Billing</h2>
<h3 id="i-noticed-that-uk-notify-supports-invoicing-is-postman-going-to-do-the-same">I noticed that UK Notify supports invoicing. Is Postman going to do the same?</h3>

<p>Postman does not bill the user separately. We believe in transparency in the pricing of our service. OGP will bear the cost of Postman’s infra. We ask the agencies to pay for the SMS and WhatsApp message cost given that these are operational costs.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-twilio-charge-my-agency">How does Twilio charge my agency?</h3>

<p>Depending on your usage, Twilio has a few different plans. If you do pay-as-you-go, you only need a corporate credit card on file. It works like prepaid mobile plan. You top-up certain amounts of money every month and deplete the account as you send SMS. Post-paid mobile plans requires you to contact Twilio’s rep and initiate a procurement process that adheres to IM8 guidelines. Contact WhatsApp Business sales representatives to find out more about their business plans. Go to <a href="/twilio-sms/" title="Postman Guide Before You Start">Before You Start - Twilio &amp; SMS</a> for more info.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-bulk-tender-for-twilio">Is there a bulk tender for Twilio?</h3>

<p>There is no bulk tender for Twilio at the moment. You can email <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">postman@open.gov.sg</code> to indicate your interest. We are collating the number of agencies that are interested in bulk tender.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/AdminLanding.svg" alt="landing page graphic" /></p>

<h2 id="what-can-postman-do">What can Postman do?</h2>

<p>Postman lets government officials mass send messages to citizens through SMS and email with minimal setup required through a user interface.</p>

<h2 id="what-problems-is-postman-solving">What problems is Postman solving?</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Communication is manual</strong>: Agency users are still calling or sending individual SMS to citizens.</li>
  <li><strong>Existing tool is not meeting the needs of users</strong>: Outlook does not support mass sending and it is often capped at 1000 emails.</li>
  <li><strong>No official source of information</strong>: Communications come in many different forms. Lacking a consistent channel puts agencies at risk of phishing attack.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you-use-postman">Why should you use Postman?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Reliable</li>
  <li>Reattempt delivery</li>
  <li>Track engagement</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="is-postman-free">Is Postman free?</h2>

<p>Sending an email is free. SMS will be charged based on Twilio’s SMS <a href="https://www.twilio.com/pricing" title="Twilio's Pricing">rates</a>.</p>

<h2 id="is-postman-secure">Is Postman secure?</h2>

<p>Email and SMS is not 100% secure. We recommend that you don’t put any sensitive information in the email or sms content. Some of our users generate a recipient specific unique link that opens up to a locked page. We will be undergoing VAPT in June 2020.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-access-postman-in-the-government-intranet">Can I access Postman in the government intranet?</h2>

<p>Postman is only available on the internet at the moment. We will announce it under <a href="./release-notes" title="Section 5: Release Notes &amp; Roundups">release notes and round ups</a> when Postman can be accessed through the government intranet.</p>

<h2 id="data-classification">Data classification</h2>

<p>When in doubt, you should follow IM8’s guidelines on data classification. Postman recommends that you write messages that are <strong>open</strong> and meant for the public.</p>

<h2 id="contribute-to-our-open-source-code">Contribute to our open-source code</h2>

<p>We have open-source Postman. Visit our <a href="https://github.com/opengovsg/postmangovsg" title="Postman Github repo">Github repo</a> to start contributing to our code.

<h1 id="section-3-power-user">Section 3: Power User</h1>

<h2 id="send-rate">Send rate</h2>
<p>Baseline sending rate for Twilio is at 10 messages per second. You do not need to put in anything if you don’t have a custom send rate from Twilio.</p>

<p>If you contacted Twilio to increase your send rate because you send &gt; 10k SMS at a time and require the SMS to be quickly sent out before the next batch, you can easily put in your send rate in step 4 right before sending your campaign (see redbox).</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/sendrate.jpg" alt="send rate" /></p>

<p>3A.5 For the avoidance of doubt, you are solely responsible for any loss of whatever nature arising from unauthorized or unofficial modifications made to your device which permit or escalate privileged access, or remove restrictions to such access, which are not intended by the manufacturer or provider of your device or operating system of your device (e.g., “rooting” or “jailbreaking” your mobile phone).</p>

<h3 id="4--third-party-materials">4.  Third Party Materials</h3>

<p>4.1.  The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third party (“Third Party”). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the “Third Party Terms”). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution platform (the “Distribution Terms”). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.</p>

<p>4.2.  It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of the same. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user. For the avoidance of doubt, where Third Party Terms are listed, such Third Party Terms shall be deemed to include any privacy policies and acceptable use policies as are applicable to you.</p>

<p>4.3.  If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party Terms. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>

<p>4.3.1.  some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the Third Party to you; and</p>

<p>4.3.2.  the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your use of the relevant third party software or service, and not these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>4.4.  If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause 4.5  below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the “Incorporated Terms”). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are complied with, the parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance.</p>

<p>4.5.  Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.</p>

<p>4.6.  For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6.</p>

<h3 id="5--your-consent-to-access-functions-of-your-device">5.  Your Consent to Access Functions of Your Device</h3>

<p>Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to certain functions of your device, such as push notifications, the obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data from you in connection with the Service. Please also see privacy policy. Your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to the access by the Service of such functions of your device as may be reasonably required by the Service.</p>

<p>5A. Ownership of Feedback/Requests/Suggestions</p>

<p>You agree that all title and interest in any feedback, requests or suggestions from you concerning the Services shall be owned by GovTech.</p>

<p>5B. Confidentiality</p>

<p>5B.1 If you receive information or data (in whatever form) from GovTech or a Third Party which is designated confidential or proprietary or is otherwise reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary (collectively, “Confidential Information”), you shall not use, disclose or reproduce the Confidential Information except for the purpose for which it was provided to you. If consent to disclose the Confidential Information to a third party is given by GovTech or the Third Party to you, any act or omission in respect of the Confidential Information by that person shall be deemed to be your act or omission and you agree to be fully liable for the same. In all cases, you shall protect the Confidential Information to the same extent you protect your own confidential information but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. You shall ensure that any recipients are bound by confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as this Clause.</p>

<p>5B.2 You shall destroy any Confidential Information immediately upon request by GovTech or the Third Party.</p>

<p>5B.3 In the event:</p>

<p>5B.3.1 you are, or likely to be, required by an order of court to disclose Confidential Information; or</p>

<p>5B.3.2 you have reasonable grounds to suspect the unauthorised use or disclosure or reproduction of Confidential Information;</p>

<p>you shall immediately notify GovTech or the Third Party of the same and cooperate with GovTech or the Third Party to prevent or limit such disclosure.</p>

<p>5B.4 Nothing in this Clause 5B shall prejudice GovTech’s or the Third Party’s other rights at law.</p>

<p>6.2.5.  any decision made or action taken by you or any third party in reliance upon the Service,</p>

<p>regardless of whether GovTech has been advised of the possibility of such damage or loss.</p>

<p>6.3.  Without prejudice and in addition to the foregoing, insofar as the Service facilitates or requires the provision, use or functioning of, or is provided in conjunction with, other products, software, materials and/or services not provided by GovTech, GovTech makes no representation or warranty in relation to such products, software, materials and/or services (including without limitation any representation or warranties as to timeliness, reliability, availability, interoperability, quality, fitness for purpose, non-infringement, suitability or accuracy).</p>

<p>6.4.  You shall not rely on any part of the Service to claim or assert any form of legitimate expectation against GovTech, whether or not arising out of or in connection with GovTech’s roles and functions as a public authority.</p>

<p>6.5.  You agree to defend and indemnify and keep GovTech and its officers, employees, agents and contractors harmless against all liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs on an indemnity basis) howsoever arising out of or in connection with your access or use of the Service (including third party software or services) or your non-compliance with the Terms of Use, Third Party Terms or Incorporated Terms, whether or not you had been advised or informed of the nature or extent of such liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses. You warrant and represent that your access or use of the Service does not and will not breach or violate any laws, regulations, trade, economic and/or export sanctions (wherever in the world) applicable to you, and that you shall not transmit any malicious code, illegal, infringing or undesirable content or materials to GovTech or its agents or any Third Party.</p>

<h3 id="7--hyperlinks">7.  Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>7.1.  Insofar as the Service provides a hyperlink to material not maintained or controlled by GovTech, GovTech shall not be responsible for the content of the hyperlinked material and shall not be liable for any damages or loss arising from access to the hyperlinked material. Use of the hyperlinks and access to such hyperlinked materials are entirely at your own risk. The hyperlinks are provided merely as a convenience to you and do not imply endorsement by, association or affiliation with GovTech of the contents of or provider of the hyperlinked materials.</p>

<p>7.2.  Caching and hyperlinking to, and the framing of, any part of the Service is prohibited save where you have obtained GovTech’s prior written consent.

If you hyperlink to or frame any part of the Service, that shall constitute your acceptance of these Terms of Use and all amendments thereto. If you do not accept these Terms of Use as may be amended from time to time, you must immediately discontinue linking to or framing of any part of the Service.</p>

<p>7.3.  GovTech reserves all rights:</p>

<p>7.3.1.  to disable any links to, or frames of, any materials which are unauthorised (including without limitation materials which imply endorsement by or association or affiliation with GovTech, materials containing inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful topics, names, or information that violates any written law, any applicable intellectual property, proprietary, privacy or publicity rights); and</p>

<p>10.2.  GovTech may assign, novate, transfer, or sub-contract the rights and liabilities in respect of the Service and this Terms of Use, without notifying you and without further reference to you. Your acceptance of this Terms of Use shall also constitute your consent to such assignment, novation, transfer or sub-contract.</p>

<p>10A. Severability</p>

<p>If any term of these Terms of Use is held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then these Terms of Use, including all of the remaining terms, will remain in full force and effect as if such invalid or unenforceable term had never been included but, to the extent permissible, such invalid or unenforceable terms shall be deemed to have been replaced by terms that are (a) valid and enforceable and (b) express the intention or produce the result closest to the original intention of the invalid or unenforceable terms.</p>

<h3 id="11--governing-law-and-dispute-resolution">11.  Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>

  <li>You’ll see a list of commands that help you create, edit, and manage your bots. Since it’s your first time, type /newbot.</li>
  <li>After giving the /newbot command, you get to pick a name and username for your bot. The name is what your users will see the bot as in their contact list and the username is how they’ll find it.</li>
  <li>With that done, you’ll be given your bot’s API token. The API token is how Telegram knows the message you send through Postman is associated with this particular bot. Every bot has its own API token, and you shouldn’t share it with anyone or they could hijack your bot.</li>

<h1 id="section-1a-twilio--sms">Section 1a: Twilio &amp; SMS</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-twilio">What is Twilio?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/" title="Twilio's Homepage">Twilio</a> is a cloud communication service that allows the users to send messages through an Application Program Interface (API).</p>

<h2 id="how-is-postman-different-from-twilio">How is Postman different from Twilio?</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>UI</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Postman provides a user friendly interface for users to easily access what Twilio has to offer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>API</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimises the <strong>rate limit</strong> to send messages in bulk</li>
      <li>Allows the user to <strong>cancel</strong> the campaign</li>
      <li>Allows the user to <strong>retry</strong> for messages that encounter errors during the first attempted delivery</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-did-postman-choose-twilio">Why did Postman choose Twilio?</h2>
<p>We evaluated other cloud service providers before we chose Twilio. We have used Twilio for SMS sending service for NDP ticketing, Digital MC, SGH’s elective surgery appointment receipt and reminder, MOH’s quarantine notice, and ICA’s location checking for those who are on quarantine notice.</p>

<p><strong>Easy to setup &amp; well documented API</strong></p>

<p>Twilio, Nextmo and AWS SNS are all cloud base SMS solutions. Twilio’s primary benefit is that there is a simple user interface with an interactive debugger. Our developers have experiences integrating with Twilio. Twilio is known for its simple, and well documented API. Given that it is easy for us to integrate with Twilio and save significant manpower hours on setting up our own SMS gateway, Twilio was chosen as the service provider.</p>

<p><strong>Reliability &amp; availability</strong></p>

<p>Twilio API success rate is 99.999% &amp; uptime is ~ 99.95% (per month).
Nexmo does not publicly declare its API success rate and uptime.
AWS does not publicly declare its API success rate but uptime is ~99.90% (per month).</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-sign-up-for-a-twilio-account">How can I sign-up for a Twilio account?</h2>
<p>You can go to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" title="Twilio's Homepage">Twilio.com</a> to sign up for an account. Twilio provides simple and flexible <a href="https://www.twilio.com/pricing" title="Twilio's Pricing">pricing plans</a> for different tiers of users.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/tip-twilio-account.png" alt="twilio account setup tip" />
This is particularly useful for a large agency with many users. Your agency might ask you to create a subproject in Twilio to track your usage. An example would be <strong>MOE</strong> at the <strong>project level</strong> and <strong>Course: ecology 101</strong> at the <strong>subproject level</strong> for ecology 101’s teacher to send SMS to parents.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/project-subproject-ex.png" alt="project subproject" /></p>

<p>If you fall under a subproject, you need to navigate to <strong>Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Subproject &gt; “Subproject name like Course: ecology 101” &gt; Settings &gt; General</strong> to obtain your subproject SID. Twilio console will indicate that you are viewing settings under a subproject using an orange font on the navigation bar.</p>

<h2 id="4-buy-a-number">4. Buy a number</h2>

<p>You need to purchase a phone number to start using Postman.</p>

<p>You can use a US number and mask the number with an <a href="https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223181348-Getting-Started-with-Alphanumeric-Sender-ID-for-Twilio-Programmable-SMS/" title="Twilio alphanumeric sender ID">alphanumeric sender ID</a>. Singapore number is only needed for 2-way SMS. Postman will support 1-way SMS at the start.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/phonenum.jpg" alt="phone number" /></p>

<p>If you wish to purchase a Singapore phone number that starts with +65, you need to complete a regulatory bundle. It will ask for an ID and business details for verification.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/reg-bundle.jpg" alt="complete regulatory bundle" /></p>

<p>Once your application for regulatory bundle has been approved then you can search for a phone number that starts with +65.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-postman-guide/assets/buy-num-1.jpg" alt="search phone number" /></p>

<p>Singapore phone number is $75 per month. We recommend that you buy a US phone number which is $1 per month if you are not doing 2-way messaging. SMS cost depends on the country code of the phone number. Please take note that a US phone number might cost more to send SMS.</p>
