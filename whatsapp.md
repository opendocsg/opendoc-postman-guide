## WhatsApp Business will not support broadcasting
We have received many agency requests to support WhatsApp messaging on Postman. We reached out to Facebook/WhatsApp to inquire the possibility. Unfortunately, the exceptions/support provided for the MCI use case cannot be extended to other agency users. 

We will not be supporting WhatsApp broadcasting for the following reasons:
1. Difficult for agencies to obtain a WhatsApp Business Account
2. High infrastructure cost for hosting the WhatsApp client
3. Resource intensive. WhatsApp requires you to verify that the WhatsApp account is still valid every 24 hours. Templates also have to be pre-approved.
