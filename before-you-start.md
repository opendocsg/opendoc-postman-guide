# Section 1: Before You Start

## Create a common email
Your login will be the primary email address that we will use to send your emails out to the recipients. Postman does not manage users for an agency. Twilio and WhatsApp credentials will be tied to an agency email account. You might have to contact your IT administrator to create a common email account that allows multiple subscribers.  

## Can I have multiple users from the same agency sharing the same account?
Sharing is caring! All users from the same agency should share one account. The rationale behind our set-up is that communications out to the public should be vetted before you press send. Each agency has its own communication guidelines & policy. We leave it up to the communication team to govern the usage of Postman. If you are sending a message broadcast to the entire country, please make sure you get your use case vetted by the [Ministry of Communications and Information](https://www.mci.gov.sg/ "Ministry of Communications and Information").  

## What are credentials?

Think of credentials as a passcode that you need to enter into a keypad in order to get into a door. We need your credentials to contact Twilio & WhatsApp Businessâ€™ API. Different services would have different credential set-up. This guide will teach you how to get them.
