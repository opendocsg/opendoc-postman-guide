## What can Postman do?

Postman lets government officials mass send messages to citizens through SMS and email with minimal setup required through a user interface.

## What problems is Postman solving?

1. **Communication is manual**: Agency users are still calling or sending individual SMS to citizens. 
2. **Phishing**: Having an official channel to send messages prevents phishing and misinformation. 
3. **Existing tool is not meeting the needs of users**: Outlook does not support mass sending and it is often capped at 1000 emails. 


## When does Postman send my message? 

Postman currently supports **send NOW**. 

## Where do messages go and how do I know that Postman delivered it successfully?

 Messages go to the recipients that you specified. Like Fedex, you can track your package. Postman tells you the number of failed deliveries and you can reattempt delivery. 

## Why should you use Postman?

1. Reliable
2. Reattempt delivery
3. Track engagement

## Is Postman free?

Sending an email is free. SMS & WhatsApp will be charged based on WhatsApp and Twilio SMS rates. 

## Is Postman secure?

SMS is not 100% secure. We recommend that you don't put any sensitive information in the sms content. Some of our users generate a recipient specific unique link that opens up to a locked page. When in doubt, you should follow IM8's guidelines on data classification.
