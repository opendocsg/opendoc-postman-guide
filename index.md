## What can Postman do?

Postman lets government officials mass send messages to citizens through SMS and email with minimal setup required through a user interface.

## What problems is Postman solving?

1. **Communication is manual**: Agency users are still calling or sending individual SMS to citizens. 
2. **Existing tool is not meeting the needs of users**: Outlook does not support mass sending and it is often capped at 1000 emails. 
3. **No official source of information**: Communications come in many different forms. Lacking a consistent channel puts agencies at risk of phishing attack.

## Why should you use Postman?

1. Reliable
2. Reattempt delivery
3. Track engagement

## Is Postman free?

Sending an email is free. SMS will be charged based on Twilio's SMS [rates](https://www.twilio.com/pricing "Twilio's Pricing").

## Is Postman secure?

Email and SMS is not 100% secure. We recommend that you don't put any sensitive information in the email or sms content. Some of our users generate a recipient specific unique link that opens up to a locked page. We will be undergoing VAPT in June 2020.

## Can I access Postman in the government intranet?

Postman is only available on the internet at the moment. We will announce it under [release ntoes and round ups](./release-notes "Section 5: Release Notes & Roundups") when Postman can be accessed through the government intranet. 

## Data classification

When in doubt, you should follow IM8's guidelines on data classification. Postman recommends that you write messages that are **open** and meant for the public.
