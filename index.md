## What can Postman do?

Postman lets government officials mass send messages to citizens through SMS and email with minimal setup required through a user interface.

## What problems is Postman solving?

1. **Communication is manual**: Agency users are still calling or sending individual SMS to citizens. 
2. **Existing tool is not meeting the needs of users**: Outlook does not support mass sending and it is often capped at 1000 emails. 
3. **No official source of information**: Communications come in many different forms. Lacking a consistent channel puts agencies at risk of phishing attack.

## Why should you use Postman?

1. Reliable
2. Reattempt delivery
3. Track engagement

## Is Postman free?

Sending an email is free. SMS & WhatsApp will be charged based on Twilio SMS rates. 

## Is Postman secure?

SMS is not 100% secure. We recommend that you don't put any sensitive information in the sms content. Some of our users generate a recipient specific unique link that opens up to a locked page. When in doubt, you should follow IM8's guidelines on data classification.
